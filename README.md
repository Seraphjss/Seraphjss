Hi how are things? Welcome to my profile. And taking advantage of the fact that you are here, I will tell you a little about myself.

## Who I am?
I am a programming fan, I dedicate myself to creating small libraries for JS. But mainly, I am dedicated to continuing with my current projects :).

## Projects ðŸš€
- Syntx.js
  - A library for NodeJS that allows you to create Discord bots in a "faster" way so to speak.
  - Developing
- API
  - My team's API (which by the way is the owner), where we have different useful endpoints for your applications, although it was created mainly to be used for Discord bots.
  - [Home (lacks re-design)](https://api.erxproject.xyz)
  - [Endpoints](https://api.erxproject.xyz/endpoints)
- Home
  - My main team's website. Where we provide various services, which for now are:
    - [API](https://api.erxproject.xyz)
    - [Multimedia host [1]](https://api.erxproject.xyz/cdn)
    - [Multimedia host [2]](https://cdn.erxproject.xyz)
    - [User (acquire your key for some endpoints of our API)](https://user.erxproject.xyz)

The tools I mainly use when it's time to program ;)
